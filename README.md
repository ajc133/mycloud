# my cloud

I'm following along with Terraform's guide for Azure cloud deployment. I went
with Azure because they're free for me. I already used my AWS Free Tier years
ago. I think that as I go along, I'll try and relate comments back to AWS.
Maybe that'll help me understand more in a "cloud-agnostic" (oh god, the
buzzwords) way
